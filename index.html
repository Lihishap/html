<h2> Tips for Travelling in Thailand</h2>
 <p> Thailand attracts many tourists, drawn to the gorgeous beaches, sparkling temples, delicious food, and laid-back way of life. A few insider tips can help make your Thailand trip that little bit easier and more enjoyable. Here are 11 top tips for your next visit to Thailand.

 <p> <b><span style= "color: red"> Carry Cash <br/></span>
 </b>
 Outside of swanky restaurants, luxury malls, and high-class hotels, Thailand is very much a cash-based society. There’s certainly little point heading to a market, for example, with a credit card. Many smaller accommodations also expect payment in cash, as do local restaurants and many attractions. Even some tour operators prefer traditional payment methods over plastic. Make sure you carry enough cash to pay for your everyday needs. ATMs are generally widely available, even in smaller towns, but if you’re heading to more off-the-grid locations or remote islands, it’s best to replenish your funds before setting off. It also pays to have a good stash of smaller notes and coins for low-value purchases; many smaller stores and taxi drivers don’t have much change.
